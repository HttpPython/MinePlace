MinePlace offers a completely new gaming experience in Minecraft. As a parody of [r/place](https://reddit.com/r/place), a world-renowned reddit community project, this project offers endless possibilities to immortalise one's creativity in MinePlace, in addition to many varied features such as joining game teams or a large number of colours.

Whether alone or as a duo, in one or many colours, in the morning or in the evening and whether Pokemon, Emoji or your own skin, MinePlace sets no limits and gives free rein to your creativity!

## What is being done against Griefer?
**Nobody likes griefers!** Not even MinePlace. In order to maintain the r/place game principle as well as the simultaneous protection against griefers, blocks can only be placed in a certain interval (here 10 seconds by default). :v:
